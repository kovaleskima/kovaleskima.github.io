## Project Overview

My project makes use of a floe-resolving sea ice model called SubZero to observe the seasonal breakup and motion of sea ice in Kobuk Lake (Hotham Inlet), near Kotzebue, Alaska. This process is crucial to Kotzebue Sound communities reliant on sea ice for hunting and fishing. 

The confined topography of Kobuk Lake leads to the seasonal ice breakup being primarily wind-driven, and a great candidate for the development and validation of SubZero. This development will be guided by high resolution aerial surveys of the lake, in-situ observations from local scientists and indigenous knowledge, and existing satellite data.
