I'm a first year graduate student in Physical Oceanography at the University of Washington, advised by Georgy Manucharyan. My current research is focused on advancing seasonal sea ice breakup modeling.

I graduated from Missouri S&T summa cum laude in May 2024 with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics. Before coming to the University of Washington, I was involved with applied math and machine learning research projects at Missouri S&T and the University of Missouri, as well as a brief stint as a software engineering intern at United Launch Alliance (ULA) working on Vulcan Centaur.

My work is an amalgamation of applied mathematics, software engineering and environmental science. 

In my free time I also love rock climbing and mountaineering!
